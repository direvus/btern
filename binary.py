Balanced ternary binary encoding
============

Tools for encoding balanced ternary data into binary formats and back again.

The encoded scheme used here uses 8-bit segments to represent 5-trit segments.
Each 5-trit segment is mapped to an 8-bit binary value which corresponds to its
value as an unsigned integer.

So, for example, consider the trit sequence:

    0-00+

This sequence interpreted as a signed number is decimal -70, and as an unsigned
number decimal 51.  We encode it using the byte value 51, or hex 0x33, which
gives:

    0011 0011

If a trit sequence is not evenly divisible into 5-trit segments, the final
segment is padded to 5 trits by adding '-' trits to the left.
