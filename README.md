Balanced Ternary
================

This library implements computations over values expressed in Balanced Ternary
form.

Balanced Ternary is a numeral system with three symbols, equating to the
decimal values -1, 0 and +1.  We use the characters -, 0 and + to represents these
values respectively.

When performing logical operations with balanced ternary values, we use the
Kleene ternary propositional logic system, where - represents False, +
represents True, and 0 represents an indeterminate value, which is either True
or False.
